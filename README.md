# Almost Video Feedback

A Chrome extension (Manifest V3) for recording **spoken + visual feedback** on a web app and
handing an AI coding agent (Claude Code, etc.) a single file that says exactly what to fix —
with screenshots correlated to what you said and did.

You hit record, talk through what's wrong while you click / select / scroll / circle the mouse
around things, and on stop it writes a session bundle to your Downloads folder and copies a
ready-to-paste prompt (containing the absolute path to `feedback.md`) to your clipboard.

```
Start ▶  →  talk + point at things  →  Stop ⏹  →  paste into your agent  →  it reads the file and does the work
```

---

## How it works

- **Transcription** runs in real time via Chrome's built-in **Web Speech API** (no API key, no
  setup). It runs in the **content script** (the live page context) — Chrome's Web Speech API
  does not produce results inside an MV3 offscreen document, so the page is the right home for it.
  A higher-quality remote engine (Deepgram / AssemblyAI / Whisper) can be added later.
- **Screenshots** are captured at strategically chosen moments and **deduplicated** so the agent
  isn't drowned in near-identical frames. Capture triggers:
  - on start, on new page load, and on in-app (SPA) navigation
  - on click, on text-selection release (the selected text is recorded too)
  - when you **circle / scribble** the mouse around something, or pause after moving it
  - after you scroll and stop
  - a periodic safety-net snapshot
  - manually — the **hotkey** or the floating **📸 Shot** button
  - Near-identical frames are culled with a perceptual hash (dHash + Hamming distance). High-intent
    triggers (start, navigation, selection, circling, manual) are never culled.
- **Overlay**: a single translucent bar shows the live transcript, elapsed time, a screenshot
  counter, and Shot / minimize / Stop buttons. It's **draggable** (grab the REC/timer area) and
  **minimizable** (collapses to a small pill), and its position is remembered. It stays put during
  captures (no flicker); minimize or move it if you want it out of a screenshot. The canonical
  "recording" state is also shown in the toolbar badge (a red ●).
- **Mic meter**: the popup shows a live microphone level so you can confirm audio is being picked up.
- **Correlation**: everything is one timestamped timeline (speech, screenshots, navigations),
  persisted to IndexedDB as it happens. On stop, each spoken segment is attached to the nearest
  screenshot in time and the whole thing is rendered chronologically.

## Output

Written to `Downloads/ai-feedback/session-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS/`:

```
feedback.md          # agent-facing: instructions + chronological entries with screenshots
session.json         # the same data, structured, for programmatic use
screenshots/0001.png
screenshots/0002.png
...
```

`feedback.md` interleaves, in order: what you did, what you said at that moment, the page URL, the
clicked/selected element, and the screenshot. The clipboard gets a prompt like:

> I recorded visual + spoken feedback on my web app. Please read the feedback file and address
> each item. Screenshots are referenced relative to the file, in the same folder.
>
> Feedback file: `C:\Users\you\Downloads\ai-feedback\session-…\feedback.md`

Paste that straight into Claude Code.

## Install (load unpacked)

**Easiest:** download `almost-video-feedback.zip` from the
[latest release](https://github.com/JustinWi/almost-video-feedback/releases/latest), unzip it,
and load that folder (steps below). Or clone this repo and load the folder directly.

1. Open `chrome://extensions`.
2. Toggle **Developer mode** (top right).
3. Click **Load unpacked** and select the folder (the one containing `manifest.json`).
4. Pin the extension so you can see the toolbar button + recording badge.

Requires Chrome 116+.

## Microphone

The first time you start recording on a given site, Chrome shows its standard in-page microphone
prompt — click **Allow**. The grant is remembered per site, so you only do it once per origin
(your own app / `localhost` included). If you block it by mistake, re-allow it via the microphone
icon in the address bar and start again.

## Using it

1. Open the tab you want to review (any normal `http`/`https` page, including `localhost`).
2. Click the toolbar button → **Start recording** (or press the hotkey).
3. Talk through your feedback while you interact with the page. A translucent bar at the bottom
   shows the live transcript and flashes "📸 Screenshot N" when one is captured.
4. Press the hotkey or the **📸 Shot** button any time you want to force a capture.
5. Click **Stop** (in the popup or the overlay). The popup pops open showing **"Recording saved"**,
   the bundle is written, and the agent prompt (with the file path) is copied to your clipboard
   automatically. The popup also lists your **last 5 recordings** — click one to view it or copy its
   prompt, or open the full **Recordings** library to view/share any of them.

> **Tip:** clicking the toolbar icon **while recording** stops the recording automatically (the
> menu opens straight to the saved result). Use the on-page overlay or the hotkey to control a
> recording without stopping it.

### Hotkeys (default — rebindable at `chrome://extensions/shortcuts`)

| Action | Windows/Linux | macOS |
|---|---|---|
| Start / stop recording | `Ctrl+Shift+Y` | `⌘+Shift+Y` |
| Force a screenshot | `Ctrl+Shift+U` | `⌘+Shift+U` |

### Recordings library & sharing

Click **📁 Recordings** in the popup (or **View & share** after a recording) to open the library.
Each past session is listed with its date, duration, and counts; expand one to see every screenshot
with the words you spoke around it and the full transcript.

**Pruning screenshots:** in the expanded view, click any screenshot to select it (shift-click for a
range, or use **Select all**), then **🗑 Delete selected** to drop the ones you don't want. This
updates the library copy used for viewing and sharing — the original files already in Downloads are
left untouched. (Click a screenshot's image to open it full-size.)

Per session you can also:

- **Share** — bundles `feedback.md` + `session.json` + all screenshots into a `.zip` and opens your
  OS share sheet (email, WhatsApp, etc.) via the Web Share API; if that's unavailable it downloads
  the zip so you can attach it manually.
- **Copy prompt** — copies the ready-to-paste agent prompt with the file path.
- **Delete** — removes it from the library (files already in Downloads are left alone).

The library keeps the most recent 40 sessions (older ones are pruned automatically).

### Settings

Right-click the extension → **Options** (or the popup's **Settings** link) to tune: transcription
language, which triggers are active, capture format (PNG/JPEG), the dedup aggressiveness, the safety
cap, and the timing thresholds for scroll/dwell/circle detection.

## Limitations

- Can't record `chrome://` pages, the Chrome Web Store, or other extension pages.
- Web Speech sends audio to Google's servers (it's not truly offline). A private/offline engine is
  on the roadmap via the swappable transcription interface.
- Files land in **Downloads** (extensions can't write to arbitrary paths). Writing straight into a
  project repo would need a native-messaging host or a small local companion app — a future option.
- Screenshots appear briefly in Chrome's downloads UI as they're written on stop.
- Recording follows one tab/window; switching to a different tab mid-session is not the intended flow.

## Development

```bash
npm test       # pure-logic unit tests (image hash, gesture math, exporter)
npm run verify # manifest references + syntax-check every JS file
npm run icons  # regenerate the toolbar PNGs
```

No build step and no dependencies — the `src/` tree loads unpacked as-is.

### Layout

```
manifest.json
src/
  common/      protocol.js (message types), config.js (settings + storage)
  background/  service-worker.js (orchestrator) + capture, dedup hash, session store (IndexedDB),
               exporter (feedback.md/json), downloads (write + resolve absolute path)
  offscreen/   clipboard write (created on stop)
  content/     overlay UI + Web Speech transcription + input tracking + capture coordination
  popup/  options/    UI pages

scripts/     icon generator + verifier
```

## Contributing

PRs and ideas welcome — it's open source (MIT). There's no build step, so getting started is just
"load unpacked + edit + reload". See **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)** for the dev loop, the
architecture, and good first contributions (new screenshot triggers, a remote transcription engine,
output tweaks). Run `npm test && npm run verify` before opening a PR.

**Making changes with an AI agent?** Read **[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)** (and `CLAUDE.md`) — it has the
conventions and the verification checklist that keep the extension loadable and in good standing.

## Roadmap

- Pluggable remote transcription (Deepgram / AssemblyAI / Whisper) for higher accuracy + privacy.
- Optional native-messaging host to drop the bundle directly into a target repo.
- Smarter screenshot selection (OCR-aware diffing, element-change detection).
