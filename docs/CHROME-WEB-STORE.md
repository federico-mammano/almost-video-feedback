# Chrome Web Store submission kit

Everything you need to publish **Almost Video Feedback** to the Chrome Web Store. The parts I could
prepare are below as copy-paste-ready text; the parts only you can do (register, upload, submit) are
in the checklist at the end.

---

## What's already prepared

- ✅ **Upload package:** `dist/almost-video-feedback-store.zip` — run `npm run pack:store` to (re)build it. The manifest is at the zip root (the store requires this).
- ✅ **Privacy policy (hosted, required):** https://justinwi.github.io/almost-video-feedback/privacy.html
- ✅ **128×128 icon:** included in the package.
- ✅ **Store images to capture:** open `docs/store-assets.html` in your browser and screenshot the framed boxes (instructions on that page).
- ✅ All listing copy, permission justifications, and the data-disclosure answers — below.

## Listing fields (copy/paste)

**Name**

```
Almost Video Feedback
```

**Summary** (≤132 chars)

```
Record spoken + visual feedback on any web app, then hand your AI agent one file of screenshots tied to what you said.
```

**Category:** `Developer Tools`  ·  **Language:** `English`

**Detailed description**

```
Describing UI bugs to an AI coding agent is tedious: you type a wall of text, take a screenshot, dig
it out of Downloads, drag it in, and explain which part you mean — for every single issue.

Almost Video Feedback turns that into talking. Hit record, describe what's broken while you click,
scroll, and select on the page, then stop. The extension transcribes what you said and automatically
captures the right screenshots, then bundles everything into one file and copies a ready-to-paste
prompt to your clipboard. Paste it into your AI agent (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, or any tool that
reads files) and it has your words and the screenshots, in order.

WHAT IT DOES
• Real-time voice transcription while you record (built into your browser — no API key).
• Smart screenshots on clicks, text selection, scroll-stops, and mouse-circling — deduplicated so
  your agent isn't flooded with near-identical frames.
• A correlated bundle: each screenshot is tied to what you said at that moment, the page URL, and the
  element you touched.
• One-paste handoff: on stop, a prompt + the file path are already on your clipboard.
• A recordings library to review past sessions, fix mis-transcribed words, prune screenshots, and
  re-share any session as a zip.

YOUR DATA STAYS ON YOUR MACHINE
There are no servers, accounts, or analytics. Recordings are saved to your Downloads folder and the
extension's local storage; nothing is sent to the developer. Transcription uses Chrome's built-in
speech feature, which (like voice typing) sends audio to the browser's speech service. Full details:

**Single purpose** (the dashboard asks for one)

```
Record a user's spoken and visual feedback about a web page and produce a single local file
(a transcript plus correlated screenshots) that the user can hand to an AI coding agent.
```

## Permission justifications (the review form asks per item)

Paste these into the "Permission justification" boxes.

| Permission | Justification |
|---|---|
| **Host permission `<all_urls>`** | The user can record feedback on any website they're reviewing, so the content script (recording overlay + input tracking) and `captureVisibleTab` must be able to run on any URL. The extension acts only on the single tab the user explicitly starts recording, and only while recording. |
| `tabs` | To capture the visible area of the tab being recorded (`captureVisibleTab`) and to read that tab's URL and title so each screenshot can be labeled in the feedback file. |
| `activeTab` | To operate on the user's current tab when they start a recording from the toolbar. |
| `scripting` | To inject the recording overlay/content script into a tab that was already open before the extension loaded, when the user starts a recording there. Only the extension's own bundled files are injected — no remote or generated code. |
| `downloads` | To save the feedback bundle (`feedback.md`, `session.json`, and the screenshot PNGs) to the user's Downloads folder. |
| `downloads.ui` | To briefly hide Chrome's download shelf while the bundle is written, so it doesn't pop up over the popup. Restored immediately after. |
| `storage` | To store the user's settings and the local library of recent recordings. |
| `offscreen` | To copy the ready-to-paste prompt to the clipboard from a background (offscreen) document after a recording is saved. |
| `alarms` | For the optional periodic "safety-net" screenshot during a recording. |
| `webNavigation` | To take a screenshot when the recorded tab navigates to a new page, so page changes are captured. |
| `clipboardWrite` | To copy the agent prompt (with the file path) to the clipboard when a recording finishes. |

**Are you using remote code?** → **No.** No `eval`, no remotely-hosted scripts, no dynamically
fetched code. All code is in the package; MV3's default CSP is enforced.

## Data-use disclosures (the "Privacy practices" tab)

Answer truthfully — these are the expected answers for this extension:

- **What user data do you collect?** The extension *handles* (locally) "Website content" (screenshots
  and page text of the page being reviewed) and audio/"Personal communications" (the user's spoken
  feedback, transcribed). It does **not transmit** any of this to the developer.
- **Is any of the data sold to third parties?** → **No.**
- **Is the data used or transferred for purposes unrelated to the item's single purpose?** → **No.**
- **Is the data used or transferred to determine creditworthiness or for lending?** → **No.**
- **Three required certifications:** check all three (no selling, single-purpose only, no
  creditworthiness use).
- In the privacy-practices notes field, you can paste: *"All recording data stays on the user's
  device (Downloads + local storage). The extension has no backend and transmits nothing to the
  developer. Voice transcription uses Chrome's built-in Web Speech API, which sends audio to the
  browser's speech service (Google); this is disclosed in the privacy policy."*

> Note: because of `<all_urls>`, the store listing will show "Read and change all your data on all
> websites." That's expected for a screenshot/review tool — the privacy policy + description explain
> why and that nothing leaves the device.

## Images you need (sizes)

**✅ Three ready-to-upload 1280×800 product screenshots are already in [`docs/store/`](store/):**
1. `01-record-on-your-app.png` — the recording overlay on a real-looking dashboard.
2. `02-recordings-library.png` — the recordings library with screenshots + transcript.
3. `03-control-center.png` — the toolbar popup (recent recordings, saved result).

Just upload those. (They're real renders of the extension's UI.)

| Asset | Size | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Store icon | 128×128 | ✅ in package |
| Screenshots | 1280×800 | ✅ 3 in `docs/store/` |
| Small promo tile | 440×280 | optional — see below |
| Marquee promo | 1400×560 | optional — see below |

For the optional promo tiles, open `docs/store-assets.html`, set browser zoom to 100%, and screenshot
the 440×280 / 1400×560 frames.

## Your checklist (the parts only you can do)

1. **Register** at the [Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/devconsole/) signed in as **justin@teachinge.org** — one-time **$5** fee. (If the console is blocked, enable the Chrome Web Store developer console for your domain in the [Google Admin console](https://admin.google.com) — you own it.) Set the **publisher display name** to **teachinge.org**.
2. Click **New item** → upload **`dist/almost-video-feedback-store.zip`**.
3. Fill **Store listing**: paste the Name, Summary, Description, Category, Language above; add the icon (auto from package), screenshots + promo tile (from `store-assets.html`), and the **homepage** URL.
4. Fill **Privacy practices**: paste the **single purpose**, the **permission justifications**, set **remote code = No**, the **privacy policy URL**, and the **data-use** answers above.
5. **Save draft → Submit for review.** First reviews typically take a few days; broad permissions can add scrutiny, which the justifications above are written to satisfy.
6. After it's approved, update the website's install buttons to point to the Web Store listing (tell me the URL and I'll switch them over).

When you're ready to ship updates later: bump `version` in `manifest.json`, run `npm run pack:store`, and upload the new zip in the dashboard.
